{"name":"CSV splitter","body":"### CSV Splitter Tool\r\nThis tool will split a TXT or CSV file into multiple TXT or CSV files. It will do this while retaining the header for the CSV file in each split file. Files are opened in a stream and so large files should not put any kind of strain on the memory usages (although this is not yet threaded so may be unresponsive for a while while processing large files, this may be fixed later if needed)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with this tool?

It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
